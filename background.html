        <h1>Early life of Prophet Mohammed</h1>
        <p>Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 AD in the desert city of Mecca in Arabia (now Saudi Arabia). His childhood name was Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Al Hashim. The Prophet's father's name was Abdullah Ibn Abdul Muttalib and his father died before the Prophet was born. The Prophet's mother's name was Bibi Amina bint Wahhab and her mother also died when he was 6 years old. After the death of his mother, the responsibility of raising the Prophet fell on his grandfather Abu Muttalib and uncle Abu Talib. And when the Prophet was 9 years old, his grandfather died. After his grandfather's death he started living with his uncle.

        Prophet Muhammad was very hardworking and intelligent since childhood. Since childhood, he was honest, of serious nature and spoke less and sweetly. Whereas the Arabs lived their lives as cheats, deceivers and liars. While living with his uncle, he used to help his uncle in his business. Seeing his truthfulness and honesty, people used to call him Al-Amin i.e. true, honest or truthful.</p>
        <h1>Married life of Prophet Mohammed</h1>
        <p>When Mohammad Saheb grew up, he started doing business. He used to help his uncle in his business since childhood. He had great faith in honesty in business. While lies, fraud, deceit and dishonesty were widespread throughout Arabia at that time, on the contrary, talk of Prophet Muhammad's hard work and honesty also spread everywhere.

        Impressed by his hard work and honesty, a 40-year-old woman named Bibi Khadija, who was much older than him and was a widow, proposed marriage to Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad accepted her proposal. Prophet Muhammad was 25 years old at that time. Prophet Muhammad had 3 boys and 4 girls from Bibi Khadija. Out of which all his sons died within 3 to 4 years of birth. While his daughters lived for 23 to 30 years.
            
        Here let us tell you that according to the Hadith, it has been believed that in Prophet Muhammad's decision to marry Khadija, widows and older women can also be married. This message was hidden. Whereas very few people know that Prophet Muhammad was the first to have a love marriage. It was he who came forward and proposed marriage. Many scholars believe that Khadija was a wealthy widow, but early evidence suggests that the marriage was born out of mutual love and respect. Later in the 20th century, Prophet Muhammad also married a girl named Ayesha. Whose age was only 9 years.
            
        At present, Nupur Sharma is being criticized all over the country after her comment on Prophet Mohammad regarding this marriage. The entire Arab country is demanding the arrest of Nupur Sharma. Whereas even then Prophet Mohammad was criticized a lot for marrying a 9 year old girl. For your information, let us tell you that Prophet Muhammad had more than 13 marriages. But he had children from only two wives. However, he mostly performed marriages to convey a social message. Simple food, simple clothes and self-care and cleanliness were included in his nature. Hazrat Mohammad was also very gentle with his family members and servants. Even while living a worldly life, he kept thinking about how to remove people from the path of evil. Sometimes he would sit for hours in the solitude of the desert and meditate deeply on this subject, and often sit in a cave and meditate. During that time he was not even able to eat or drink.</p>

In this, Jibril read some verses of the Quran mentioning the name of Allah and asked Prophet Muhammad to repeat it after him. As soon as Jibril uttered the name of Allah, Muhammad began to read the message. Accepting Allah's message, Prophet Muhammad kept repeating it throughout his life. His words were memorized and stored.

        The Prophet Muhammad believed that Allah had chosen him as His messenger. So he started giving the message of Allah to others. When Muhammad Sahib took this message to the people, he had to face a lot of opposition. But when he gave this message to the people in Mecca, after hearing this message the people accepted him as their prophet. But the people of Quraysh became jealous of him and started opposing him.
            
        The opposition increased so much that Muhammad Sahib had to leave Mecca and go to Medina. In Islam this event is called Hijra.

            <p>Hazrat Muhammad was from the tribe Quraysh, which was a believer in God of Abraham. Shaybah was the son of Hashim. Shaybah was named Abdul Muttalib. Abdul Muttalib had ten sons. While doing charity work of well-digging in Mecca, he promised Allah that after completion of work he will sacrifice one of his sons in the name of Allah. Then the day came. According to the ritual, to know what deity intended, he kept ten arrows, writing the name of each son on them, in front of an idol. Then the arrow named Abdullah on it, moved towards the idol and it was believed that God is asking that son for sacrifice.

            Preparations for sacrificing Abdullah started. All the people advised him not to do so, but Abdul Muttalib was bound to his words for sacrificing one son. People started making outcry in sorrow. Then a soul entered the body of a priest and said that sacrificing Camel also would be acceptable. This was a hope of relief. He asked people to go to the lady who was an astrologer in a village. People went to her to ask how many camels should be sacrificed to save Abdullah's life. The lady asked people to add ten more camels to the decided number of camels to proceed by writing those on a slip. Also, add the slip of Abdullah's name. Then she asked to keep choosing the slips till the slip of the camel doesn't come out. At last, it went to 100 camels. And after sacrificing 100 camels, they all came back leaving them as it is, they saved Abdullah's life. 
                
            Later, on-time Abdullah was married to Amina. After a few days of marriage, they were traveling with a merchant convoy, but Abdulla fell ill on the way. They stayed at Madina and there he died, leaving Hazrat Muhammad in mother Amina's womb. All this is mentioned in the book Biography of Hazrat Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) by Mohammad Inayatullah Subhani, translated by- Naseem Fhazei Falahi.

            <h2>Marriage Life of Hazrat Muhammad </h2>
            <p>Hazrat Muhammad grew into a young man with unusual physical beauty as well as generous in character. His sense of fairness and justice was so revered that people used to call him al-Amin means, the trusted one. He had a keen interest in spirituality.

            When he was 25 years old, prophet Muhammad married to a 40-year-old, wealthy widowed woman Khadija. She bore 3 sons ( Qasim, Tayyab, Tahir) and 4 daughters ( Zenab, Ruqeyyah, Um Kulthum and Fatima) to Hazrat Muhammad. They were living happily but not so long.  An orphan from childhood, Hazrat Muhammad suffered from the loss of his three sons too. Hazrat Muhammad married to another woman to give her children a shelter.

            <h1>Spiritual Life of Prophet Muhammad</h1>
            <p>From the very childhood, Hazrat Muhammad was gifted with a generous personality and kind heart. He used to meditate in Hira cave. Muhammad was a god seeker. When Hazrat Mohammed turned 40 years old then, the time came when the knowledge was about to shower upon the prophet Muhammad. One day he saw a dream which made him, cleared that happiness is evanescent. All the happiness and pleasure is momentary.</p>
            <h2>Angel Gabriel Appeared to Hazrat Mohammad</h2>
            <p>Hazrat Mohammed used to mediate in Hira Cave. After Ramadan, one morning,  an elegant angel named Gabriel came and forced Hazrat Muhammad to read the piece of silk. Prophet Muhammad replied that they do not know to read. He chocked the throat of Hazrat Muhammad. Muhammad felt clenching in body, then again he forcefully asked to read the piece. Frightened Muhammad asked what to read. Then Gabriel said-

            "Recite in the name of your Lord who creates. Who, created man from a clot! Recite for your Lord is most generous, who taught man by pen, taught man what he knew not."
               
            Mohammed immediately remembered everything that the angel told. Angel went back. Muhammad was sweating in fear. Muhammad didn't know who was he. Muhammad was shivering in fear, suddenly a voice came - "Muhammad!" Hazrat Muhammad saw  that angel was standing in the form of a man, he said- "You are Allah's messenger and I am Gabriel."
               
            This made Muhammad in jitter. And he started shivering extremely. That face was visible everywhere to Muhammad. Then Hazrat Muhammad came to Khadija and asked her to cover him. That angel was sent by Kaal Brahm. The simple logic is here that God is merciful, God never tortures any of his soul. And angels sent by God are always polite and loving. But these angels of Kaal Brahm give knowledge of supreme God but not tell ever the proper way of devotion to Anyone.
